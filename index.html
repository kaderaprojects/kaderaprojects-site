    <h1>Welcome to TheKader Blog</h1>
    <p>This is the first post. I’ll use this space to document projects, learning paths, home lab work, and anything worth sharing as I build.</p>

    <p>Cybersecurity has always been a core part of my work and my curiosity. I enjoy breaking down complex vulnerabilities, testing tools in my home lab, and learning how attackers think so I can build stronger defenses. My goal with this blog is to share what I learn, explain concepts in plain language, and help others strengthen their own security skills.</p>

    <p>Over time, I’ll be posting walkthroughs, security notes, and my thoughts on real-world risks, cloud security, and building a strong cyber mindset.</p>
